      <p class=""><strong>King Sejong the Great</strong> was the fourth ruler of the Joseon Dynasty of Korea, and a beloved Korean folk hero. Highly educated and a gifted military strategist, he is most famous for commissioning the creation of the phonetic Korean alphabet Hangul by scholars of the Hall of Worthies, despite strong opposition from officials educated in Hanja; the "Hangul" alphabet continues to be used today.

Under his patronage Korean literature and culture flourished. He encouraged technological advances in weaponry and initiated the use of printing presses</p>
