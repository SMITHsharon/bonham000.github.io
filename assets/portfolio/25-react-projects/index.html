				<h1 class = "contentTitle">What is React?</h1>
				<p class = "contentText">React is a powerful and influential JavaScript library developed by Facebook and open sourced a few years ago. It is being adopted increasingly throughout the JavaScript world, despite being met with some skepticism initially. It describes itself as the 'V' in the MVC model, uses a virtual DOM to render HTML updates in a very efficient manner, and allows you to write HTML within your JavaScript code (really!). It's getting quite popular:</p>

				<h1 class = "contentTitle">Learning the React Ecosystem</h1>
				<p class = "contentText">After finishing the Front End Certification at <a target = "_blank" href="http://freecodecamp.com">Free Code Camp</a>, I proceeded confidently into the Data Visualization Projects... only to be quickly shut down. React was way over my head. I had no idea how to write React components, deal with state, bind ‘this’— what is ‘this’ anyway?  It was here that I had to take a step back and reevaluate my learning process. I needed to really learn React. Incidentally, the Free Code Camp curriculum for React was still being developed at this time, so I was definitely on my own at this point.</p>

				<p class = "contentText">I decided to start from scratch and build 25 projects using React. I would only proceed to the Free Code Camp challenges when I had a very clear idea of how I would build them. As my knowledge of React grew, I decided to go back and re-build all of the major Front End Projects. This was actually a very interesting experience because it allowed me to see a comparison of how I could build these projects with and without React. If you're interested, I summarized that experience and compared my two attempts <a href = "../front-end-projects/index.html">here</a>.</p>

				<p class = "contentText">After rebuilding the Front End Projects I had about 20 simple projects coded in React and I felt ready to return to the React Challenges in Free Code Camp. I did so and successfully completed them, working much more efficiently than I otherwise would have been capable of. I think this is largely due to slowing building up my skills from the very basics to more advanced concepts before even attempting these challenges.</p>

				<p class = "contentText">Learning React in this way was really only possible because of some of the excellent educational resources some developers out there have taken the time to create. To help any future newcomers to the React world, I've compiled below a list of some resources I encountered while learning React and can definitely recommend to anyone else interested in learning this exciting library.</p>
